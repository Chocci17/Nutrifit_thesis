# NutriFit Vercel Deployment Notes

- All filenames and links must be lowercase and use hyphens (e.g., `profile.html`, not `Profile.html`).
- If you see a 404 error, check the filename and link casing.
- The `vercel.json` file is set up for clean URLs and rewrites.
- Make sure all assets (images, videos) are present in the repo or update links to hosted versions.

## Local Test

You can test locally with:

```sh
npx serve .
```

## Deploy

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Connect the repo to Vercel.
3. Deploy!

If you add new pages, update `vercel.json` rewrites as needed.
